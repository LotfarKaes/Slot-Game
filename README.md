## Slot Game
### Overview
The project is to build a small, full stack JavaScript application. The application is a simple game
which can display a random outcome generated on the server using NodeJs.
### Features: 
#### General
##### The application must work in major desktop and mobile devices.
##### The general principles by which the application will be evaluated are maintainability, testability and
reusability.
##### Unit Tests. The key is that the code is testable.
### Client
##### Using JavaScript ES6 
##### The user able to trigger a request for outcome to the server.
##### The outcome displayed to the user using the provided graphical resources (Symbol_0.png,
Symbol_1.png,…)
##### The type of win displayed to the user (No Win, Small Win, Big Win)
##### A bonus feature implemented. If the server returns bonus, the client must first display any
win to the user, then trigger an additional request without any user input (this must also be indicated
to the user in some form)
### Server
##### A Node.js application.
##### Be written in ES6.
##### Be able to serve needed resources to client.
##### Able to receive requests from client and return an outcome (three random integers
between 0-5).
##### There must be three types of outcomes: No Win, Small Win, Big Win. Two equal integers constitutes a
Small Win. Three equal integers constitutes a Big Win.
##### Server must randomly (in addition to the outcome) return if bonus feature should be triggered or not.

### Implement process:
##### 1. Create project.
##### 2. Add index.html file in public folder and include game js &css files.
##### 3. Implement game logic.
##### As usual select the folder Node.js apps run npm install and then command “node app.js” to start the server, then open http://localhost:3000
